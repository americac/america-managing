## Annual goals - _YEAR_

- Current role and level:
- Desired career track: _technical IC, management, other role at GitHub, etc._

Goals should be an evolving conversation between an IC and their manager. They should be S.M.A.R.T. - Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound and be based off the person’s engineering level.

### Levels assessment

With your manager, take a look at the Engineering levels and expectations for your current level, assess where you are, and identify some tangible areas of improvement.

| Component                         | Expectations                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Communication                     | _exceeds expectations, meets expectations, or does not meet_ |
| Interaction & Relationships       | _exceeds expectations, meets expectations, or does not meet_ |
| Knowledge & Practices             | _exceeds expectations, meets expectations, or does not meet_ |
| Leadership                        | _exceeds expectations, meets expectations, or does not meet_ |
| Operational Excellence            | _exceeds expectations, meets expectations, or does not meet_ |
| Problem Solving & Decision Making | _exceeds expectations, meets expectations, or does not meet_ |
| Scope of Position                 | _exceeds expectations, meets expectations, or does not meet_ |


### Set long term goals

Work together with your manager to come up with some S.M.A.R.T. goals. Be sure to include both technical areas of improvement as well as interpersonal. A well-rounded engineer is able code as well as work well on a team!

**S – Specific –** The more specific you can be with writing down your objective, the easier it will be to clearly see what it is you need to accomplish. Often, answering the five “W” questions—Who, What, Where, Why, and Which—can help you achieve greater specificity.

**M – Measurable –** Can your goal be measured? How will you know when you’ve achieved your goal?

**A – Attainable –** Another way of putting this is “realistic.” Is it possible to achieve the goal you’ve set for yourself?

**R – Relevant –** For businesses, a relevant goal means that it has the potential to impact your business objectives, vision, or values.

**T – Time-bound –** Give your goal a deadline.

To write these SMART goals, try to do the following: 

- **Component**: (Technical/Interpersonal)
  - Skill and description with time frame

Example:

- **Operational Excellence**: (Technical)
  - Get better at code review by participating or pairing with others in code review at least once a week
- **Communication**: (Interpersonal)
  - Improve communication with team members by participating in more team conversations, technical or interpersonal, to improve team cohesion. Speak up in regularly recurring team meetings ~once a week or participate in Slack conversations in public team channel ~3x a week
